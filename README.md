Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment

- Begin by ensuring you have Node.js and
npm installed on your computer.
- Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where you 
want to create your habit tracker app.
- Use the npx create-react-app command to
generate a new React application. 

Step 2: Design Your App Components

- Create the following components:
- App.js: This serves as the main component.
- HabitForm.js: This component handles
the addition of new habits.
- HabitList.js: This component displays
the list of habits.

Step 3: Design the Habit Form Component

- Open the HabitForm.js file in your code editor.
- Define the state to manage the input for new habits.
- Implement functions to handle changes to 
the input and submission of the form.

Step 4: Design the Habit List Component

Open the HabitList.js file in your code editor.
Set up a sample list of habits as placeholders for now.

Step 5: Integrate Components in Main App

- Open the App.js file in your code editor.
- Import the components you've created.
- Insert the imported components within the App 
component to display the habit form and list.

Step 6: Styling and Additional Functionality

Apply CSS or consider using a styling library 
such as styled-components to improve the design.
Implement the logic in the HabitForm.js component
to add newly entered habits to the list.
