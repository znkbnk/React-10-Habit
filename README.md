Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment

Begin by ensuring you have Node.js and npm installed on your computer. These tools are essential for managing packages and running JavaScript applications.

Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where you want to create your habit tracker app.
Use the npx create-react-app command to generate a new React application. This command sets up a basic project structure and installs the necessary dependencies.
Access the newly created project folder by using the cd command.

Step 2: Design Your App Components

Organize your code by creating separate components to manage different parts of your app.

Inside the src directory, establish a sub-directory called components.
Create the following components within the components directory:
App.js: This serves as the main component.
HabitForm.js: This component handles the addition of new habits.
HabitList.js: This component displays the list of habits.

Step 3: Design the Habit Form Component

Build the component responsible for adding new habits to the app.

Open the HabitForm.js file in your code editor.
Define the state to manage the input for new habits.
Implement functions to handle changes to the input and submission of the form.

Step 4: Design the Habit List Component

Create the component that displays the list of habits.

Open the HabitList.js file in your code editor.
Set up a sample list of habits as placeholders for now.

Step 5: Integrate Components in Main App

Bring all the components together in the main App.js file.

Open the App.js file in your code editor.
Import the components you've created.
Insert the imported components within the App component to display the habit form and list.

Step 6: Styling and Additional Functionality

Enhance the visual appearance and add more features to your habit tracker app.

Apply CSS or consider using a styling library such as styled-components to improve the design.
Implement the logic in the HabitForm.js component to add newly entered habits to the list.
Explore options for managing and storing the list of habits, such as utilizing localStorage for simple data persistence or more advanced solutions like Redux or React Context.
